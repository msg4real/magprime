Dear Department Heads,

Staff Suite has, as you know, had some changes this year. We are now serving a cold menu for breakfast & lunch, as well as hot dinners provided by local caterers.

Most of the previous policies remain in effect: 

Carryout will be handled in the same way (please pick up your order forms from #5217, we’ll have them printed and ready). Carryout orders are only available for lunch and dinner, and only for volunteers/staff who are scheduled to work through meal service hours. Please send a runner each day to drop off the order forms as soon as your staff have filled them out.

Gatorade and water reservations have been calculated by last year’s consumption. Beverages will be available for pickup from 11AM-3PM at Expo E (behind Autographs) Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Beverage allotments are available here: https://bit.ly/2ShOVKx
